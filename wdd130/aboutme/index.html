    <h2>Pattie Stoddard</h2>
    <h2>My favorite title is Grandma!</h2>
    <p>Hello all! My name is Pattie Stoddard. I live in Lindon, UT and love to see where everyone is from. I've been a Pathway missionary for 3 years and decided to take advantage of this amazing program. I started my college career in the late 1970's learning how to program the computer on punch cards! Yikes! That was before the personal computer was even invented. Ha! I had to stop school because of finances and life... sound familiar to anyone? I was finally able to go back and get an associate's degree in 2012. Now I can afford to get a bachelor's degree! Yay!</p>
    <p>I have 2 kids and 2 grandkids. Those boys have their grandma wrapped around their little fingers. ;) My husband passed away 18 years ago and I learned that life is what happens while making other plans. I owned an online business for several years and am now retired and excited about life-long learning.</p>
    <p>I was raised in the church. (My parents are converts.) One of my favorite quotes is from Joseph Wirthlin: "Gratitude is a mark of a noble soul and a refined character. We like to be around those who are grateful. They tend to brighten all around them." This is my personal goal. And I am grateful for Pathway!</p>
